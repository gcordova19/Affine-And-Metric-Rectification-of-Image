# Affine-And-Metric-Rectification-of-Image
Under a projective transformation ideal points may mapped to finite points and line at infinity is mapped to a finite line. However, if the transformation is affine, then line at infinity is not mapped to a finite line, but remains at infinity. we can recover the affine properties from images using algorithm described in pdf. 
Metric properties is recovered from image of a plane by transforming the circular points to their canonical positions. If circular points is identified in an image, and the image is then rectified by a projective transformation H that maps the image circular points to their canonical positions on line at infinity. Then the transformation between the word plane and the rectified image is similarity.
